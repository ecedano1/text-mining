Here's an analogy for all of you "tactical" players. Imagine you're in a math class, and it's a breeze for you but everyone else is struggling, even though they're using a calculator. You finish all the tests 3x faster than anyone else and you get high scores, all without using a calculator. The teacher doesn't make you come to class on Fridays, because you're doing so well you deserve to get rewarded.
Then next year you get a teacher who requires you to show your work. He thinks the other students are getting upset because you're finishing so much faster than they are. He wants to make sure they don't drop the class. You've never needed to show your work in the past, and while you know how to do that, you've never had to waste your time with it before. You were smart enough to do it all in your head. Now you're only finishing your tests a few minutes ahead of everyone. Still doing well but not fast enough to get significantly rewarded for it. Your intelligence isn't lacking, it's the rules holding you back from showing your full capabilities.
This is what it's like going from Infinity Ward's last CoD to this one. The maximum speed at which you can do things in this CoD is so god damn slow that the skill gap is almost nonexistent.
No one finds camping impressive, because it's easy as shit. We all know how to do it. You shouldn't feel like you're some genius who came up with the strategy. It's literally what 99% of people do when they get their first CoD. Congrats on not getting better after your first month of playing.
