"The whiniest community in gaming will never shut up and never just own up to “needing more practice”.
I know so many COD gamers who make an excuse for every single time things don’t go their way. No one ever will admit when the opposing player(s) simply owned them. 
It always has to be 1 of a thousand excuses. I no longer know who to believe when they state a reason for their overall loss or why they died. 
I’ve watched friends simply just suck..and still have several different reasons per round why things aren’t going great for them. 
These games do something to people; that turns them into whiny and bitter when they get anhilated one round...but then act perfectly happy when next round they do good. 
There will always be people better than you...and your alternative to accepting that is outrage that’s directed at everything BUT your own wrong doings. 
It can’t always be that the opposing players are cheap. How does getting killed by a camper turn into “he’s camping...even though he killed me that means no skill on his part...I can’t be bad...he’s cheap!” Such cringey excuses I hear regularly. 
If you prefer infinite warfare; running super fast with minimal stealth then go ahead and sell MW. Also stop saying “it was never a stealth game! It was supposed to be fast arcade style”. 
A series doesn’t have to have 1 feel/style. Be thankful there’s different styles of games and it’s not the same thing every year. 
MW style pleases a lot of people and clearly pisses off a lot of others..just accept that. 
If you play a game like MGS and have no patience to sneak around; you’ll fail...same with this game. 
Edit: if you downvote atleast have a counter argument. Otherwise you likely fit into the player type I described above"
