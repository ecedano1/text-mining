Everyone constantly bitches and moans that each new COD is a re-skin of the last. 
The most innovative COD in a minute drops, and now people just want a re-skin of Black Ops 4. 
Hopefully Infinity Ward can distinguish in this clown show the legitimate criticism from the people who just spend their entire day bitching on this website just to bitch.
Great game IW. 
Definitely needs some tweaks like any game that just came out, but this is one of the best COD games yet.
